BUILDING TIC-TAC-TOE :  

 -> AT FIRST WE HAVE CREATED A ARRAY KNOWN AS "human_array[9]" OF CHARACTER TYPE  
 WHICH ACTS AS AN DATABASE FOR RETREVING THE OPTED VALUES.  
 
 -> THEN WE PRINTED THE OUTLINE STRUCTURE OF THIS GAME SUCH THAT USER WILL OPT FOR DESIRED VALUE AS PER SHOWN STRUCTURE.  
 ->NOW WE WILL BE ASKING FOR INPUT FROM THE USER   
 -> PARALLELY WITH THE HELP OF "RAND()" FROM "TIME.H" HEADER FILE WE WILL TAKE INPUT AS BOT.  
                     srand(time(0));  
                     
       *NOTE THAT RAND FUNCTION DONT KNOW WHETHER THE INPUT VAUE IS REPEATED/NOT 
       SO WE HAVE AGAIN CHECKED FOR REPITETION ON SEPERATE BASIS
       
       * FOR GENERATING THE VALUE WITHIN THE LIMITS WE HAVE USED A FUNCTION:
               bot_opt=(rand()%(upper-lower+1))+lower;
    
-> AFTER TAKING THE INPUTS FROM BOTH HUMAN & BOT WE HAVE DISPLAYED THE CURRENT POSITION AT EACH TIME  
FINALLY WE HAVE DISPLAYED THE FINALY WINNER  

NOTE : THIS IS BASIC LEVEL OF TIC-TAC-TOE
